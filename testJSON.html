    <h2>Overview</h2> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuietly isolated, Manly Peak stands at 7,196 feet on the boundary between Death Valley National Park and Manly Peak Wilderness. The Wilderness is comprised entirely of jagged ridges and deep canyons within the Panamint Mountains. Vegetation alters as you gain elevation from around 1,100 feet, where creosote bush scrub dominates, to the higher elevations, where pi√±on and juniper woodlands reign.  \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nThe demanding terrain features rapid elevation changes, and the easiest approaches to the summit of Manly Peak are along the ridges to the northeast and east. Streams that flow from springs in the larger canyons feed a riparian habitat of cottonwoods and desert willows, and provide water for wildlife including a herd of desert bighorn sheep. As you explore the area, you'll find some evidence of long-abandoned mining operations. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor more information about this wilderness, please visit <a href=\"https://wilderness.net\">Wilderness Connect</a>.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<p>   \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<h2> Leave No Trace </h2><p>   \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow to follow the seven standard Leave No Trace principles differs in different parts of the country (desert vs. Rocky Mountains).

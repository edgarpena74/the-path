## Description

The Path is an app designed to function as a search engine that allows the user to look for outdoor activities. The app first uses the U.S. National Park API to gather the bulk of the activity data and then the data gathered is used in a reverse geocode API to get the location of the activities. In the future the user will be able to create an account and save their favorite locations.

## Languages

HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript

## Frameworks

Node.js, MERN, Express.js

## Libraries

React-Bootstrap, React, React Query

## Database(s)

MongoDB

Note: On the first stages of deployment to heroku there were problems with MongoDB Atlas clusters which prevented MongoDB from being used after deploying. In order to have the app run smoothly I had to temporarily remove the mongoDB features. In the future I will look for a way to work around this problem or switch to a different database.
